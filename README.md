# Course-assignments-CS-
This github repo is an on-going collection of the coding assignments completed by me (Jessica Alonso) for my programming courses in my pursuit of a bachelor's degree 
in Computer Science.
The main purpose of this collection is to show the progress I am making as I learn how to code, compile, and execute programs through various college courses.

It is important to note that many of the early assignments for these introduction courses will seem rudimentary, but I believe it is just as important
to include these as they can be used to show changes to my approach to different problems/assignments as I am introduced to new coding concepts.

Below is a list of relevant courses with a description explaining the purpose of the course, as well as the grade received (if applicable). 
This list will be updated as needed to include any new courses or updates on the final grade received as the semester progresses.

Fall 2022:
- COP 1334 Introduction to C++ Programming:
"Students will learn the syntax and rules of the C++ language, including how to code, compile, and execute programs. Students study program design, structured modular 
programming arrays, report generation, and file processing" (copied from COP 1334 syllabus made by Alejandro Roque).
Final Grade: A

- COP 1047C Introduction to Python Programming:
"Students will learn the syntax and rules of the Python language, including how to code, compile, and execute programs. Student will learn program design, structured 
modular programming arrays, report generation, and file processing" (copied from COP 1047C syllabus made by Rodolfo Cruz).
Final Grade: A



Spring 2023 (Currently enrolled for):
- COP 2800 Java Programming:
"This is an intermediate level programming course using the Java computer language. Students will learn to code, compile, and execute programs while learning advanced 
programming concepts and object oriented programming and design concepts and principles" (copied from COP 2800 course description on MDC student portal).
Final Grade: N/A

- COP  2335 Object-oriented Programming using C++:
"This second course in C++ programming is recommended for Computer Science and Computer Information Systems majors. Students will learn techniques and skills of object 
oriented programming including object-oriented modeling, analysis, and design" (copied from COP 2335 course description on MDC student portal).
Final Grade: N/A
